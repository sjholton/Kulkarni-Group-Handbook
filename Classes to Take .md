## Classes to Take

Here is a list of classes students in the group have found interesting or useful. 
Note: 
- Some specialized classes aren't offered every year
- Some classes are much harder than others, you can check 
that your courseload is manageable by messaging the group on slack


#### Fall
-	CHE 155 Computer Methods in Chemistry
-	CHE 204 Math Methods in Chemistry
-	MAT 167 Applied Linear Algebra (Note: focus on theory)
-	CHE 210C Quantum Chemistry
- STA 206 Regression Analysis I
- ECS 230: Applied Numerical Linear Algebra (Note: focus on computing)
- PHY 240A: Condensed Matter
- CHE 226: Transition Metal Chemistry

#### Winter
- STA 135 Multivariable Data Analysis
- STA 207 Regression Analysis II
- CHE 215 Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
- CHE 210A Quantum Chemistry
- CHE 211B Statistical Mechanics
- ECH 261 (Taught by Professor Faller)
- STA 220 Data Analysis and Web Technologies
- PHY 240B: Condensed Matter

#### Spring
- ECS 171/271 Machine Learning (Note: ECS 171 is currectly only available for undergrads, so pick 271 if you want)
- EMS 298: Intro To Materials Simulation (Taught by Professor Mason)
- CHE 210B Quantum Chemistry
- STA 208: Statistical Machine Learning (Note: focus on both theory and application)
- STA 243: Computational Statistics (Note: useful but R is the only language)
- STA 221: High Performance Statistical Computing
- ECS 032B: Object Oriented Programming (Note: you would not recieve credit for this course as a graduate student)
- PHY 240C: Condensed Matter

Add ECH/EMS 290 and 299 with Ambar to receive credit for lab work and group meeting (in addition to 290 lecture series in your first year)
